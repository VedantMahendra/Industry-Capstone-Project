# Employee Attrition Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes a dataset from the HR department of Salifort Motors to provide data-driven suggestions for improving employee satisfaction and reducing attrition rates. The dataset contains various features related to employee demographics, job satisfaction, performance ratings, etc.

## Objectives

* Analyze the dataset to understand the factors influencing employee attrition.
* Build predictive models to identify employees likely to leave the company. 
* Provide actionable insights and recommendations to the HR department based on the analysis.

## Deliverables

1. **Model Evaluation**: Includes evaluation metrics for the logistic regression and tree-based machine learning models (precision, recall, f1-score, accuracy).

2. **Data Visualization**: Provides visualizations related to the factors influencing attrition.

3. **Ethical Considerations**: Discusses ethical implications of using employee data for predictive modeling. 
 
4. **Resources Used**: Lists the resources used for troubleshooting and finding solutions during the project.

## Methodology

* **Data Cleaning**: Preprocessed the dataset to handle missing values and encode categorical variables.

* **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Explored the dataset to understand the distribution of various features and their relationship with attrition.

* **Feature Engineering**: Created new features and transformed existing ones to improve model performance. 

* **Model Selection**: Used logistic regression and tree-based machine learning models to predict employee attrition.

* **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated the models using precision, recall, f1-score, and accuracy on the test set.

## Results  

* The logistic regression model achieved a precision of 80%, recall of 83%, f1-score of 80%, and accuracy of 83% on the test set.

* The decision tree model achieved an AUC of 93.8%, precision of 87.0%, recall of 90.4%, f1-score of 88.7%, and accuracy of 96.2% on the test set, after conducting feature engineering.

## Conclusion

* The models and the feature importances extracted from the models confirm that employees at the company are overworked. 

* Recommendations to retain employees:

    * Cap the number of projects that employees can work on.
    
    * Consider promoting employees who have been with the company for at least four years.
    
    * Reward employees for working longer hours or don't require them to do so.
    
    * Inform employees about the company's overtime pay policies. 
    
    * Hold discussions to understand and address the company work culture.
